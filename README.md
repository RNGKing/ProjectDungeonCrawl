# ProjectDungeonCrawl

Contained within this repository is a few test builds of a randomized dungeon crawl experiment I'm building. 

Requires Unity 5.6.1f to run

Current bugs:
    Turn System is broken, possible source within        MonsterControl.cs that is causing the turn system to always flipa nd never stop on the player.
